"Here are a few things"
"to get you started with supercollider."
"Supercollider is designed"
"as a real-time environment,"
"so bits of code"
"can be evaluated on-the-fly."
"To evaluate code"
"you use command return."
"If you're evaluating"
"a single line of code,"
"just place your cursor"
"anywhere on the line"
"and hit command return."
"If you'd like to evaluate"
"more than one line of code,"
"then you just highlight"
"whatever you want to evaluate,"
"and press command return."
"You can also use parentheses"
"to declare a scope"
"of code to evaluate."
"The parentheses work similar"
"to evaluating a single line."
"Your cursor can be anywhere"
"within the parentheses"
"and when you press command period,"
"everything within the parentheses"
"is evaluated."
"The semi-colon delineates"
"the end of one statement,"
"and the beginning of another"
"You can see in this example,"
"when I try to evaluate it,"
"it throws an error"
"That's because"
"the first statement"
"is missing a semi-colon."
"If I put a semicolon after"
"the first statement,"
"supercollider realizes"
"that these are two statements,"
"and it evaluates them fine."
"In most cases,"
"spaces are not taken into account"
"in supercollider."
"For example this line"
"has a few extra spaces,"
"but supercollider evaluates the line"
"just as if the spaces weren't there."
"The supercollider IDE"
"will wrap your text,"
"and wrapped text"
"is treated as a single line."
"As you as you've already seen,"
"the post line  or post LN command"
"posts items the post window."
"Post L N post the item"
"and then adds a line, a hard return."
"The post command"
"does not add a new line."
"Commenting a single-line"
"is done with two forward slashes"
"and you use"
"the slash astrisk notation"
"to comment out"
"multiple lines or a paragraph."
"We've already discussed"
"the post window."
"The post window"
"will post things"
"you've posted to it,"
"and it will also display errors."
"The supercollider environment"
"consists of"
"a server and a client"
"The server handles"
"all of the audio processes,"
"and the client"
"is a programming environment."
"So to make sound"
"you have to boot the server."
"You can do this with command b."
"or the command s.boot;"
"You can reboot the server"
"with s.reboot"
"And there's a number"
"of other commands"
"to boot the server"
"You can see"
"the server docs for help"
"To stop sound,"
"and this is very important,"
"you use command-period."
"If you want to"
"do a complete restart"
"of everything,"
"you can recompile the server,"
"and the keyboard shortcut"
"for that is command shift L."
"There's a pretty good help system"
"and you get help"
"by pressing command D"
"If there's a particular item"
"you want to look into"
"you highlight the word"
"and press command D"
"This will bring up"
"the help doc for that item."
"You can evaluate code directly"
"from the help files"
"or from examples"
"in the help files"
"Here a couple"
"of useful server utilities"
"You can make"
"a little GUI for the server"
"by using the s.makeWindow command"
"The GUI has volume control"
"you can quit and reboot the server"
"and it has a quick recording button"
"S.meter can bring up"
"a little audio meter"
"and it shows you signal levels"
"of ins and outs"
"The freakscope shows you"
"a waveform visualization"
"Hopefully that is enough"
"to get you started"
"Happy supercolliding"
